     """Returns the times at which heel strikes and toe offs happen based on the forca plate data.
     
     Methods
     ==========
     A treshhold is being defined as a percentage of total body weight (constant * body_mass * 9.81) and heel strike 
     happens when the vertical ground reaction force goes above a treshhold after being below the treshhold. Toe off 
     happens when the vertical ground reaction force goes below a treshhold after being above the treshhold.   
     
     Parameters
     ==========
     fp_data : dataframe
        A dataframe with two columns including left and right vertical ground reaction force in N

        body mass in kg
     constant : float

              constant * body_weight at the preceding time index.
        TOL : All indices at which fp_data['for_l_y'] is less than constant * body_weight and it was greater than 
              constant * body_weight at the preceding time index.
        HSR : All indices at which fp_data['for_r_y'] is greater than constant * body_weight and it was less than 
              constant * body_weight at the preceding time index.
        TOR : All indices at which fp_data['for_r_y'] is less than constant * body_weight and it was greater than
